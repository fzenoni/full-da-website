## About Intelligent Systems and Data Analytics
Intelligent systems are a new wave of embedded and real-time systems that are highly connected, with massive processing power and performing complex applications. Their pervasiveness is reshaping the real world and how we interact with our digital life. These intelligent systems are creating new opportunities for industry and business, and new experiences for users and consumers. They can be found in all domains, where Altran is a Belgian and global leader in the Engineering R&D market: automotive, rail, aerospace, energy, healthcare, telecoms and consumer electronics.

Talking about the Data Analytics team, our academic background is in engineering and/or physical sciences, and our job is all about making sense out of data. We're spread between Brussels and Ghent (and sometimes Leuven). **We created this blog in the attempt to give back some of the passion and love we got from the online community in all these years.**
